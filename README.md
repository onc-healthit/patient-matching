The test dataset used in the ONC Patient Matching Algorithm Challenge is available for download by students, researchers, or others interested in additional analysis and patient matching algorithm development. 

The dataset containing 1 million test patients was split into eight files of alphabetical groupings by the the patient's last name, plus an additional file containing test patients with no last name recorded (Null). All files should be downloaded and merged for analysis.
